# Contributions
Every member has to complete at least 2 meaningful tasks per week, where a single development task should have a granularity of 0.5-1 day. The completed tasks have to be shown in the weekly TA meetings, and you are required to ensure traceability of your work by linking git commits to development tasks. You have one "Joker" to miss one weekly TA meeting and another "Joker" to once skip continuous progress over the remaining weeks of the course. Please note that you cannot make up for "missed" continuous progress, but you can "work ahead" by completing twice the amount of work in one week to skip progress on a subsequent week without using your "Joker". Please communicate your planning **ahead of time**.

Note: If a team member fails to show continuous progress after using their Joker, they will individually fail the overall course (unless there is a valid reason).

**You CAN**:
- Have more than two commits per week.
- Link issues to commit descriptions for better traceability.
  
**You CANNOT**:
- Link the same commit more than once.
- Use a commit authored by another team member.
